# restaurant
This is a project that I am working on as a student learning C++. It is not yet finished. 
The idea of this prject is simple: a customer comes in to a restaurant and he is given a menu, fro which he can choose the dishes.
some dishes may not be available,
some dishes may be not what the customer ordered,
the customer will be able to leave a comment on his/her experience in the restaurant,
the customer will be able to leave a tip,
and maybe more options that i will think of in the near future while writting this program.

if you have any tips or comments, please tell me, I will be very grateful.
Thank you! :)
